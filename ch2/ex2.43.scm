;;; Exercise 2.43.
;;;
;;; Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queens
;;; procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does
;;; manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6Ã— 6 case.) When Louis
;;; asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order
;;; of the nested mappings in the flatmap, writing it as

(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

;;; Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how
;;; long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle,
;;; assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T.

;;;;

;; Louis Reasoner's interchange results in having to calculate
;;
;; (queen-cols (- k 1))
;;
;; for each new row at column k, whereas the uninterchanged version only
;; calculates it once at column k.
;;
;;
;; The uninterchanged version has complexity
;;
;; T(k) = T(k-1) + board-size * C-adjoin + C-safe * k
;;
;; while the interchanged version has complexity
;;
;; T(k) = board-size * T(k-1) + board-size * C-adjoin + C-safe * k
;;
;; Therefore, T(k) = O(k^2) for the uninterchanged version, but T(k) = O(e^k)
;; for the interchanged version.
